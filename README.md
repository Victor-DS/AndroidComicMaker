# Comic Maker
A simple comic maker for Android.

This is one of the first apps that I built for Android, originally back in 2013. I'm not even sure this code even works or if there are any missing pieces. My main motivation behind it is to document one of the first piece of codes that I wrote and published on Google Play, so if you want to see what the code looks like for a person who never wrote an Android application before, head to the releases and check the source for the v1.0.
